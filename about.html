		Courabie offers the ultimate coffee and cookie experience. We hand-pick our gourmet coffees from 
		responsibly-sourced, sustainably-grown Deeper Roots roasters (Cincinnati, OH) and pair them with 
		our light, healthy homemade shortbread cookies and biscottis to guarantee a pleasant morning 
		or dolce-far-niente afternoon. </p>

		We couple the finest coffee with a unique Greek cookies made by Irene's family that is more delightful 
		than any other treat we've ever paired with coffee. We are proud to create a space that is welcoming, 
		enjoyable and with sleek modern design.</p>
